// Hello everyone, My name is Mike DeLucco and I am a member of the development team for Troubled Hamster. I worked with Yondy Kang, our scrum manager Shin Uesugi, and our product owner Eric Schmidt to devope a product called Flock Docs. 

Flock Docs solves a problem that we all encountered during our time here at Hack Reactor, which is that often times API documentation falls short of explaining how it works. Flock Docks solves this problemm by suplementing the API documentation of new libraries with additional resources such as stack over flow, example code and annotations right in the browser.
